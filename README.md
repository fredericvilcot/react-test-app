This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This little exercise written in TypeScript allows you to test a candidate's knowledge, in particular on the basics of how React works (lifecycles, props, state, hooks, JSX, conditional rendering)


## Getting Started

`git clone git@github.com:fredericvilcot/react-test-app.git`

Install dependencies

`yarn install`

Start the webpack server. The server will run at localhost:3000.

`yarn start`
